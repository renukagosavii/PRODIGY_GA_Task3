# Task-03: Text Generation with Markov Chains

**Author:** Renuka Gosavi  
**Organization:** Comillas Negras / ProDigy Infotech  

## Objective

Implement a **simple text generation algorithm** using **Markov Chains**.  
The model predicts the next word or character based on the previous ones, creating coherent text sequences.

## How It Works

1. Prepare a **text dataset** to train the Markov model.  
2. Build a **Markov chain dictionary** storing probabilities of next words or characters.  
3. Generate new text by selecting the next word/character based on the current state and the probabilities learned.

## Files

- `markov_text_gen.py` – Python script to generate text using Markov chains.  
- `sample_output.txt` – Example output generated by the script.  


## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  
2. Open terminal in the folder containing the script.  
3. Run the script:

```bash
python markov_text_gen.py
